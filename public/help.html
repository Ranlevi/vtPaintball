    Text Tag: A Text-Based Virtual Laser Tag Game.

    FAQ:
    
    What is this game?
    A multiplayer shot'em-up game, where players run around in a maze of virtual rooms and shot each other. 
    There's no graphics involved: everything is textual, and actions are performed using links and buttons. 

    How do I enter (or create) a game?
    To create a new name:
      1. In the Lobby, press your username --> Create A New Game.
      2. You will be teleported to the Red team's spawn room.
      3. To invite other players to your game, Click 'Copy Game ID' - and share the given ID with
         other players waiting in the Lobby. They can join your game by clicking their names, pressing 'Join a Game'
         and entering the given ID.
      4. When enough players have joined the game, click 'Start'.

    How To Join an existing game?
      I have a game ID:
        1. Click your username -> Join A Game.
        2. Paste the ID. You will be teleported to the game area.
      I don't have a game ID:
        1. Click the Game List Button -> Use.
        2. View the list of available public games (if any). 
        3. Click one of the games -> Join This Game.

    How to play?
      1. The game begins when the game's creator clicks 'Start Game'.
      2. There are two teams: Red and Blue.
      3. First team to reach Max Score wins.
      4. Find a Gun. Click on it -> Hold.
      5. When you encounter an enemey, click its name -> Shot.
      6. If you hit, the enemy will teleport to his/her spawn room and your team will get a point.

    What else should I know?
      - The Say command allows you to talk to everyone in your room.
      - The Tell command is for direct messaging with another player.
      - The game's creator can change the game's parameters before the game starts.
      - If a game is marked as Private, it won't show up on the Game List Button.
      - You can't join a game which already started. 
      - You can edit your avatar's description. 
      - Each player has several fixed inventory slots (Hold, Head, Torso, Legs, Feet) and ten general
        purpose slots. 
        - The Remove command moves an item from the fixed slots to the general purpose slots.
        - The Drop command drops an item to the room's floor.

    A Textual Laser Tag game???...WTF?
      Long Answer:
        Text based games, like books, are taking place in the player's imagination. I strongly believe that
        if done properly, a text based game can be just as fun as a graphics-based game, while being
        a lot easier to create and a lot cheaper to run.

      Short answer:
        I don't know how to do graphics.

      of a tribute to these fun times...
