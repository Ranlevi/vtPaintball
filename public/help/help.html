            <div class="subtitle">Long Answer:</div>
            <p>Text based games, like books, are taking place in the player's imagination. I strongly believe that if done properly, a text based game can be just as fun as a graphics-based game, while being a lot easier to create and a lot cheaper to run.              
            </p>
            <div class="subtitle">Short answer:</div>
            <p>
              it's easier than doing graphics.

            My name is Ran Levi. I'm a podcaster, author, Electronics Engineer and Developer. I love writing code! As a teenager growing up in the 90's, I've played MUD games and fell in love with text-based games. Text Tag is a sort of a tribute to these fun times...
