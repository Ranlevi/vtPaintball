Textual Holodeck
----------------
A city with houses. Streets have names.
Doors lead to creative area for a specific user.
The user spawns infront of their door.
The door has a sign to descrive the content.
Maybe add a button to randomly teleport to another door.
A user has an amount of rooms. He can disable unneeded exits.

Users can create and modify whatever they want.
No dying or killing - pure role playing. 
A user can claim ownership of an empty room (or renounce it)
Only an owner can edit a room.
visitors can't get anything out of a room.
The world needs to be saved.
Users can teleport to a room with it's id (which can be copied from the cmds)
IDs should be short.
Need to create a help page.

Each users has a Holodeck, which is a collection of rooms that he owns.
An empty holodeck room has a button. Pressing it generates the deck and assiangs onwership. 

Inside an holodeck only the owner can create stuff.
Anyone can edit what they are wearing in the holodeck.
Only the owner can take things out of the holodeck.
outside the holodeck, things on the floor expire.

There's an admin account.

- World class holds all the entities, and methods to manipulate the database.
- Each entitiy class is responsible for itself. Adding to the world and spawning other entities is handled outside.

An infinite corridor. Each door is a holodeck assigned for someone.
No need for changing ownership.
Each holodeck has 100 rooms cube.
User spawns in his holodeck, or teleport home.
Decks created dynamically.

todo:
Corridor rooms should not have the option to edit exits, since they are 
created automatically when a new user logs in.
