The user spawns in a lobby. 
He can chat with other users, or commands: create / join #### (some code).

He can also edit some game parameters: max num of users, max score. etc.
The spawn room has equipment that users can take.
Users can change teams (red or blue).
The user who created the game enters the start command.

When two users meet, one can shot the other. The losing side respawns, game score 
is updated.
